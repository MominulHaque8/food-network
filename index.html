            <p>Try to avoid: fried rice, fishcakes, spring rolls, prawn crackers, satay skewers with peanut sauce, and
                sweet and sour dishes. Healthier options: clear soups such as tom yum, salads, stir-fried meat, fish or
                vegetable dishes, and steamed seafood dishes, such as fish or mussels.</p>

                    1-2
                    minutes. Add the chilli paste and fish sauce, stir through then add the prepared prawns and let them
                    poach in the soup for 30 seconds. Make sure the soup isnâ€™t boiling at this point so not to over-cook
                    them. Turn the heat off and allow to cool for a few minutes before adding the lime juice.
